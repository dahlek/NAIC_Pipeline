Scripts and programs outside of the direct NAIC pipeline

Seeing_finder - Uses calstar cubes to find the FWHM of the star as a function of wavelength and calculate the average seeing for a given cube.

Spectral_resolution_calculator - calculates the average spectral resolution of NAIC filters based on how the FWHM of the central lobe changes as a function of wavelength.

Disk_averaged_spec_maker - Program to pull a raw spectrum from a list of Jupiter images by fitting an ellipse to Jupiter in each image and taking the average of the counts within that ellipse.

F_std_convolver - Program for convolving filter functions with standard model spectra.

Plate_scale_finder - Finds the plate scale based on binary star measurements

Spectral_leakage_fix - uses NAIC filter functions and Karkoschka disk-averaged spectrum to find a corrective factor that can be applied to a NAIC I/F spectrum

To do:
-Maybe make Spectral_leakage_fix a bit more readable
-Add function that scales standard spectra (original version in http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Desktop/NAIC_pipeline_testrun/NAICprograms_june2018/photometry/Standard_spec_extraction_950.ipynb)
-Add generalized notebook that takes Laser measurements and makes FTFs (use Desktop/Filter_Transmission_Functions/727_filter_tests.ipynb as reference)
