Brief description of how to run this pipeline; order of operations.

Data reduction:
1. Image_checker: sort and review data and lists of images
2. Data_reduction_pipeline: flat division, pixel correction, RF-off subtraction, Gaussian filters, etc.
Photometry:
3. Ap_phot: Conduct aperture photometry of cal star cubes
4. Tau_flux_fit: Derive average optical depth of the atmosphere, find star flux at top of atmosphere, use these values to derive photometric conversion factor
